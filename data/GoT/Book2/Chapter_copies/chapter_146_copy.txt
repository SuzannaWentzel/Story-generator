"It was Theon," Bran said blackly. ALINEA
"No. Look." She pointed across the yard with her spear. "That's one of his ironmen. And there. And that's Greyjoy's warhorse, see? The black one with the arrows in him." She moved among the dead, frowning. "And here's Black Lorren." He had been hacked and cut so badly that his beard looked a reddish-brown now. "Took a few with him, he did." Osha turned over one of the other corpses with her foot. "There's a badge. A little man, all red." ALINEA
"The flayed man of the Dreadfort," said Bran. ALINEA
Summer howled, and darted away. ALINEA
"The godswood." Meera Reed ran after the direwolf, her shield and frog spear to hand. The rest of them trailed after, threading their way through smoke and fallen stones. The air was sweeter under the trees. A few pines along the edge of the wood had been scorched, but deeper in the damp soil and green wood had defeated the flames. "There is a power in living wood," said Jojen Reed, almost as if he knew what Bran was thinking, "a power strong as fire." ALINEA
On the edge of the black pool, beneath the shelter of the heart tree, Maester Luwin lay on his belly in the dirt. A trail of blood twisted back through damp leaves where he had crawled. Summer stood over him, and Bran thought he was dead at first, but when Meera touched his throat, the maester moaned. "Hodor?" Hodor said mournfully. "Hodor?" ALINEA
Gently, they eased Luwin onto his back. He had grey eyes and grey hair, and once his robes had been grey as well, but they were darker now where the blood had soaked through. "Bran," he said softly when he saw him sitting tall on Hodor's back. "And Rickon too." He smiled. "The gods are good. I knew . . . " ALINEA
"Knew?" said Bran uncertainly. ALINEA
"The legs, I could tell . . . the clothes fit, but the muscles in his legs . . . poor lad . . . " He coughed, and blood came up from inside him. "You vanished . . . in the woods . . . how, though?" ALINEA
"We never went," said Bran. "Well, only to the edge, and then doubled back. I sent the wolves on to make a trail, but we hid in Father's tomb." ALINEA
"The crypts." Luwin chuckled, a froth of blood on his lips. When the maester tried to move, he gave a sharp gasp of pain. ALINEA
Tears filled Bran's eyes. When a man was hurt you took him to the maester, but what could you do when your maester was hurt? ALINEA
"We'll need to make a litter to carry him," said Osha. ALINEA
"No use," said Luwin. "I'm dying, woman." ALINEA
"You can't," said Rickon angrily. "No you can't." Beside him, Shaggydog bared his teeth and growled. ALINEA
The maester smiled. "Hush now, child, I'm much older than you. I can . . . die as I please." ALINEA
"Hodor, down," said Bran. Hodor went to his knees beside the maester. ALINEA
"Listen," Luwin said to Osha, "the princes . . . Robb's heirs. Not . . . not together . . . do you hear?" ALINEA
The wildling woman leaned on her spear. "Aye. Safer apart. But where to take them? I'd thought, might be these Cerwyns . . . " ALINEA
Maester Luwin shook his head, though it was plain to see what the effort cost him. "Cerwyn boy's dead. Ser Rodrik, Leobald Tallhart, Lady Hornwood . . . all slain. Deepwood fallen, Moat Cailin, soon Torrhen's Square. Ironmen on the Stony Shore. And east, the Bastard of Bolton." ALINEA
"Then where?" asked Osha. ALINEA
"White Harbor . . . the Umbers . . . I do not know . . . war everywhere . . . each man against his neighbor, and winter coming . . . such folly, such black mad folly . . . " Maester Luwin reached up and grasped Bran's forearm, his fingers closing with a desperate strength. "You must be strong now. Strong." ALINEA
"I will be," Bran said, though it was hard. Ser Rodrik killed and Maester Luwin, everyone, everyone . . . ALINEA
"Good," the maester said. "A good boy. Your . . . your father's son, Bran. Now go." ALINEA
Osha gazed up at the weirwood, at the red face carved in the pale trunk. "And leave you for the gods?" ALINEA
"I beg . . . " The maester swallowed. "A . . . a drink of water, and . . . another boon. If you would . . . " ALINEA
"Aye." She turned to Meera. "Take the boys." ALINEA
Jojen and Meera led Rickon out between them. Hodor followed. Low branches whipped at Bran's face as they pushed between the trees, and the leaves brushed away his tears. Osha joined them in the yard a few moments later. She said no word of Maester Luwin. "Hodor must stay with Bran, to be his legs," the wildling woman said briskly. "I will take Rickon with me." ALINEA
"We'll go with Bran," said Jojen Reed. ALINEA
"Aye, I thought you might," said Osha. "Believe I'll try the East Gate, and follow the kingsroad a ways." ALINEA
"We'll take the Hunter's Gate," said Meera. ALINEA
"Hodor," said Hodor. ALINEA
They stopped at the kitchens first. Osha found some loaves of burned bread that were still edible, and even a cold roast fowl that she ripped in half. Meera unearthed a crock of honey and a big sack of apples. Outside, they made their farewells. Rickon sobbed and clung to Hodor's leg until Osha gave him a smack with the butt end of her spear. Then he followed her quick enough. Shaggydog stalked after them. The last Bran saw of them was the direwolf's tail as it vanished behind the broken tower. ALINEA
The iron portcullis that closed the Hunter's Gate had been warped so badly by heat it could not be raised more than a foot. They had to squeeze beneath its spikes, one by one. ALINEA
"Will we go to your lord father?" Bran asked as they crossed the drawbridge between the walls. "To Greywater Watch?" ALINEA
Meera looked to her brother for the answer. "Our road is north," Jojen announced. ALINEA
At the edge of the wolfswood, Bran turned in his basket for one last glimpse of the castle that had been his life. Wisps of smoke still rose into the grey sky, but no more than might have risen from Winterfell's chimneys on a cold autumn afternoon. Soot stains marked some of the arrow loops, and here and there a crack or a missing merlon could be seen in the curtain wall, but it seemed little enough from this distance. Beyond, the tops of the keeps and towers still stood as they had for hundreds of years, and it was hard to tell that the castle had been sacked and burned at all. The stone is strong, Bran told himself, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. So long as those remained, Winterfell remained. It was not dead, just broken. Like me, he thought. I'm not dead either. ALINEA
